3. Given an object/dictionary, containing names as keys and amount_paid by each of them as
values, write a function that takes such an object as input and calculates the total sum paid by them together.






def totalamount(sum):
 amount=0
 for i in sum.values():
  amount = amount + i
 return amount
sum = {"Gokul" : 100, "Mani" : 200}
print ("amount:",totalamount(sum))
